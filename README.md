# Maze Generator and Pathfinding visualizer.

This is a HTML/CSS/Javascript project to visualize the most popular or well-known algorithms that can be used to generate mazes and solve those mazes.
Originally the idea was to only make the maze generation algorithms but I got side tracked a bit and ended up writing some pathfinding algorithms aswell...  
That is why the code of the pathfinding algorithms is not commented well (not that the rest of the project is) and contains a lot of duplicated code.

I got the idea to make this visualizer from https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer but I tried to make an original spin-off and
did not copy any code or assets.

Update: I added some computational geometry algorithms aswell because I saw most of them in a course I take. I thought it would be a great way to learn those
algorithms was to implement them myself. I did not implement all the algorithms that I planned on implementing because it took more time then anticipated.
This is why the computational geometry page looks a bit bare and unpolished. 

Yes, the color palette is not great.
