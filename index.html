                    <p>This is a hobby project to visualise algorithms to better understand them and (mainly) because it is fun to look at. 
                       The code is definitely not wrote with optimisation in mind and edge cases are not always supported. I would have liked 
                       to include more computational geometry algorithms, like the Delaunay triangulation or perhaps some way to create
                       fractals, but because of the non-optimised pipeline that is how I write code, this project took longer than expected (a classic). 
                       Perhaps I will add some new algorithms after I have forgotten how tedious the bugfixing process is (not that this code is bugfree). Sorting algorithms is
                       also one I would see myself visualise in the future. A last remark: I am not colorblind, I am just not capable of picking great colors.</p>
